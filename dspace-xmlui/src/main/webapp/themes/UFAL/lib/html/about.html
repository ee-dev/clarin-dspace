		<p>
The OTA collects, catalogues, preserves and distributes high-quality digital resources for research and teaching. We currently hold thousands of texts in more than 25 different languages, and are actively working to extend our catalogue of holdings. The OTA relies upon deposits from the wider community as the primary source of high-quality materials. The OTA is part of the i<a target="_blank" href="https://www.clarin.eu/">CLARIN</a> European Research Infrastructure; it is registered as a CLARIN centre, and OTA services are part of the University of Oxford's contribution to the <a href="http://www.clarin.ac.uk/">CLARIN-UK Consortium</a>.

		<h3 id="about-ipr">Intellectual Property Rights</h3>

This means that depositors are solely responsible for taking care of IPR issues before publishing data or tools by submitting them to us.
