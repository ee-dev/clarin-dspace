	<div>
	<h3 id="what-is-the-repository">What is the repository?</h3>
	<p>It is like a library for digital texts, as well as for some other types of literary and linguistic data. It's an open, online location where people can search for texts and easily download them. It's a place where texts can be stored safely and shared with others. The goals are to make it easier to find and use the texts, and to make sure that they remain available and usable for a long time into the future.</p> 
	</div>
	
	<div>
	<h3 id="what-submissions-do-you-accept">What submissions do we
		accept?</h3>
	<p>We accept high-quality digital texts and related resources: full text, corpora,
		lexicons, etc.</p>
	<p>
		When uploading language resources, please try to use one of the recommended formats
		mentioned in <a href='http://www.clarin.eu/sites/default/files/Standards%20for%20LRT-v6.pdf'>LRT Standards</a>.
	</p>
	</div>
	
	<div>
	<h3
		id="do-i-need-to-create-an-account-to-download-andor-make-a-submission">Do
		I need to create an account to download or make a submission?</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>You can download <strong>data with a
				licence that allows free sharing</strong> without any obstacles. Just read
			the licence and download. This applies to all data with <a
			href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/" target="_blank">Creative Commons</a> and
			tools with <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses" target="_blank">open source</a>
			licences.
		</li>
		<li>To download datasets that require you to sign a
			licence, you need to 
			log in. However, if you are from the academic world in Europe, you probably don't
			need any new account.</li>
		<li><strong>Just click &quot;Login&quot; and search for
				your academic institution.</strong> To sign in, you can use any account with
			an Identity Provider that is a member of EduGAIN federation.</li>
		<li>If you don't have an academic account that works with us, let
			us know. We might be able to an account for you on our system.</li>
	</ul>
	</div>

	<div>
	<h3	id="cant-login">I see an error logging in</h3>
    <p>Please let us know through our <a class="helpdesk-tolink" href="#">Help Desk</a>, if you have any trouble logging in.</p>
    <p>Ocassionally (usually when you are the first one logging in using your home institution) you might see an error stating &quot;<strong>The authentication was successful; however, your identity provider did provide neither your email, eppn nor targeted id.</strong>&quot; This means your home institution did not send us enough data about you to operate our service; the institution is doing so to protect your personal data. We only require an email and we are following <a href="http://www.geant.net/uri/dataprotection-code-of-conduct">Data Protection Code of Conduct</a>, which helps us convince the institution we won't abuse data about you.</p>
    <p>If you have an account with multiple providers and you login with different one each time, you might see error stating &quot;<strong>Your email is already associated with a different user.</strong>&quot;. Please try to use the same provider each time, if that is not possible, let us know and we'll change the default one.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div>
	<h3 id="why-should-i-submit-my-data-into-your-repository">Why
		should I submit my data into your repository?</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>It is free and safe.</li>
		<li>We respect your licence. We encourage open data, and believe
			it benefits not only users, but also the data providers. However we
			accept also more closed data and we can make users sign a licence
			before downloading your data, if that is what you need.</li>
		<li>The data is visible, giving you maximal credit for your work
			(visible via Google, VLO, DataCite, OLAC, Data Citation Index, arXive.org, etc.).</li>
		<li>The data is easy to cite. We provide <em>ready-to-use</em>
			one-click citations in BibTex, RIS, and other popular reference
			formats. All the citations include permanent links created from persistent identifiers (we use handles for PIDs). 
            These PIDs are future-proof.
		</li>
	</ul>
	</div>
	
	<div>
	<h3 id="what-is-the-handle-good-for">What is the PID (handle) good for?</h3>
	<p>It is a special permanent URL. It provides a permanent link that
		will resolve correctly even if in some distant future the data is
		moved. Thus it should be used as URL in citations.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div>
	<h3 id="what-is-deposit-procedure">What is the procedure for depositing and archiving?</h3>
	<p>During the submission of digital language resources to the repository, the data undergo a curation 
    process in order to ensure quality and consistency. We assist you in meeting necessary requirements 
    for sustainable resource archiving. Data have to be provided with metadata in standard formats 
    accepted/adopted in the respective communities, persistent identifiers (PIDs) have to be assigned, IPR 
    issues have to be resolved and clear statements with regard to licensing and possible use of the 
    resources are to be made.</p>

    <p>The depositor is also required to electronically sign a deposit agreement acknowledging that 
    they are the holder of relevant rights to the data and that they have the right to grant the 
    rights contained in this licence.</p>

    <p>Once the data is deposited in the repository it is assigned a PID for stable and persistent reference. </p>
	</div>

    <div>
	<h3 id="how-to-update">What if I want to update the archived data?</h3>
	<p>Every change to the resources and metadata should be stored as a new version with a new PID.
    However if the changes are minimal (e.g., typos or clear mistakes) then contact our <a class="helpdesk-tolink" href="#">Help Desk</a> with
    the submission PID and the changes which should be made. It is up to the reviewer to decide whether these changes
    should result in a new version or not.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
	<h3 id="how-to-delete">What if I want to withdraw the resources in the future? Can I delete the data?</h3>
    <p>Yes, in this case contact our <a class="helpdesk-tolink" href="#">Help Desk</a> with the submission PID and the reason. 
    However, we need to keep a reference that the data was in our repository (because a persistent identifier was issued), so the
		administrative metadata will be retained, indicating that the data itself were removed.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
	<h3 id="how-to-embargo">I don't want to make the data publicly available or make 
    them available after a specific date. Would you still archive them for me?</h3>
    <p>In accordance with the advocacy of the research infrastructures and the general development 
    with respect to Open Access, we strongly encourage the data producers to be as open as possible.
    
    However, in other circumstances we might be able to archive your data even if they will not be publicly available. Please, contact 
    our <a class="helpdesk-tolink" href="#">Help Desk</a> prior to completing the submission.</p>
    </div>


    <div>
	<h3 id="how-to-cite">How to cite a submissions?</h3>
	<p>See our <a href="./about">policies</a>.</p>
    </div>
	
	<div>
	<h3 id="how-safe-is-my-data-if-i-store-it-with-you">How safe is my
		data, if I store it with you?</h3>
	<p>Quite safe, probably much more than in your computer. Our
		storage plan:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>All the data in the repository have an on-site backup copy.</li>
		<li>There is another off-site copy, so even complete destruction
			of our building does not destroy your data.</li>
		<li>We check all the copies regularly and should any of them
			become corrupted we delete it and make a new one.</li>
		<li>We keep at least three copies, one of them off-site, at all
			times</li>
	</ul>
	</div>
	
	<div>
	<h3 id="what-license-should-i-pick-for-my-datatool">What licence
		should I pick for my data/tool?</h3>
	<p>
		We encourage using a free and open licence. A representative selection of free
		licences (including Creative Commons licences appropriate for datasets) is
		available directly during submission. There is an <a href="./deposit#license_selector">OPEN License Selector</a> which can guide you through the selection of appropriate license.<BR/>
		If for some reason you need a different licence, <a class="helpdesk-tolink" href="#">Contact Us</a>.
	</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h3 id="list-of-licenses">Where can I find more information about supported licences?</h3>
		<p>
			The list of licences currently supported is <a href="licenses" id="available-licenses">here.</a>
			However, do not hesitate to <a class="helpdesk-tolink" href="#">Contact Us</a>
			in case you need your specific licence. The licences can be accompanied by various requirements; eg. limiting to logged in users, filling additional details (purpose) etc.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h3 id="real-authors">Why do we strongly prefer real authors to institutions?</h3>
		<p>
			It is not about contact, it is about citations, credit and trust. That is why we have separate metadata
			fields for authors and for the contact person. The contact person can be an institution or a helpdesk, but an author cannot. We support the direct citation of data
			(<a href="https://www.force11.org/datacitation">https://www.force11.org/datacitation</a>).
			That is why we also give them PIDs, create formatted citations, etc. That is the reason we really want proper authors, so that they get citations and others know whose work they rely on.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h3 id="searching">How do I get the most of my searches?</h3>
		<p>
			In contrast to other search engines this one uses OR as a default operator; see examples below that clarify this. If you are not satisfied with the results of your searches, you might wish to go beyond plain text searches.
			You may search only in certain fields, use negation, add score (emphasis) to some parts of the query and match
			more. The search engine is SOLR so you can learn and use SOLR syntax - find out more in <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/The+Standard+Query+Parser">the SOLR documentation</a>.

		<h4>Examples of search queries</h4>
		<p>
		<dl>
			<style scoped="scoped">
				dt{
					padding-top:5px;
					padding-bottom:5px;
				}
			</style>
			<dt><a href="../discover?query=national+corpus">national corpus</a> vs <a href="../discover?query=national+AND+corpus">national AND corpus</a></dt>
			<dd>The default operator is OR; ie. the first example searches for national OR corpus in all text fields.</dd>
			<dt><a href="../discover?query=dc.title%3AB%3FC+%26%26+-dc.title%3Acorpus">dc.title:B?C &amp;&amp; -dc.title:corpus</a></dt>
			<dd>Returns all items having B?C in title - ? stands for any character (eg. BNC) - and not having corpus in the title</dd>
			<dt><a href="../discover?query=dc.title%3A%22National+Corpus%22">dc.title:"National Corpus"</a></dt>
			<dd>Use double quotes (&quot;) for exact matches and multiword expressions</dd>
<!--			<dt><a href="../discover?query=author%3A%28Bojar+%26%26+-Tamchyna%29+%26%26+%28dc.language.iso%3A%28ces+AND+eng%29+OR+language%3A%28czech+AND+english%29%29">author:(Bojar &amp;&amp; -Tamchyna) &amp;&amp; (dc.language.iso:(ces AND eng) OR language:(czech AND english))</a></dt>
			<dd>Search for items by one author and not the other; interesting are only items about both czech and english languages.</dd> -->
