<h3 id="introduction">Introduction: a digital-text repository</h3>

<p>A digital-text repository is like a library for literary and linguistic data, allowing users to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Search for texts and other resources and easily download them;</li>
<li>Deposit data and be sure that it is safely stored, everyone can find it, use it, correctly cite it (with appropriate acknowledgements and restrictions).</li>
</ul>


<p>The Oxford Text Archive (OTA) provides repository services for literary and linguistic datasets. In that role the OTA collects, catalogues, preserves and distributes high-quality digital resources for research and teaching. We currently hold thousands of texts in more than 25 languages, and are actively working to extend our catalogue of holdings. The OTA relies upon deposits from the wider community as the primary source of materials. The OTA is part of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.clarin.eu/">CLARIN</a> European Research Infrastructure; it is registered as a CLARIN centre, and OTA services are part of the University of Oxford's contribution to the <a href="http://www.clarin.ac.uk/">CLARIN-UK Consortium</a>.

<h3 id="about-contracts">Licence Agreement and Contracts</h3>
<p>The OTA requires and operates under agreements and licences covering deposit and use of archived digital materials.</p>
<ul>
<li>For every deposit, we enter into a standard contract with the submitter, the <strong>Deposit Agreement</strong>, in which we describe our rights and duties and the submitter acknowledges that they have the right to submit the data and gives us (the repository centre) the right to distribute the data on their behalf.</li>
<li>Everyone who downloads data is bound by the <strong>Licence</strong> assigned to the item — in order to download protected data, one has to be authenticated and needs to electronically sign the licence. A list of available licences in our repository can be found <a href="licences" id="available-licences">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div>
<h3 id="about-ipr">Intellectual Property Rights</h3>
<p>
As mentioned in the section <a href="#about-contracts">Licence Agreement and Contracts</a>, we require the depositor of data or tools to sign a Deposit Agreement, which specifies that they have the right to submit the data and gives us (the repository) the right to distribute the data on their behalf. This means that depositors are solely responsible for taking care of IPR issues <em>before</em> publishing data or tools by submitting them to us.
<br />
Should anyone have a suspicion that any of the datasets or tools in our repository violate Intellectual Property Rights, they should contact us immediately at our <a class="helpdesk-tolink" href="#">Help Desk</a>.
